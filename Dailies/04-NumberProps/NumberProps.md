In the `number_props.c++` files, write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter an integer greater than one but less than ten.  Then generate four lines of output:

1. The first line should describe whether the user's input is less than, equal
   to, or greater than five.
2. The second line should describe whether the user's input is prime or
   composite. (There's no built-in function for this, but you can check
   directly since you know which numbers less than 10 are prime.)
3. The third line should describe whether the user's input is an even number
   or an odd number. To receive full credit for this part, your program
   must use the "%" operator.
4. The fourth line should show the value of the user's input squared. Here are three example
   runs. Remember, the samples show both program output and user input. You must use your
   intelligence to tell the difference. If you don't know what this means, ask for help.

Sample 1:

        Please enter an integer greater than one but less than ten: 3
        3 is less than 5.
        3 is a prime number.
        3 is an odd number.
        3 squared is 9.

Sample 2:

        Please enter an integer greater than one but less than ten: 6
        6 is greater than 5.
        6 is a composite number.
        6 is an even number.
        6 squared is 36.

Sample 3:

        Please enter an integer greater than one but less than ten: 5
        You entered the number five.
        5 is a prime number.
        5 is an odd number.
        5 squared is 25.

Your output needs to look ***exactly*** like this. Make sure to proofread your
code for spelling, spacing, and indentation, and comment it thoroughly.

When you are satisfied with your program, submit this assignment and upload
your file. If you do not have the right filename, you will receive ZERO points
for the assignment.
