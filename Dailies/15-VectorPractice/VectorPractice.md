Vector Practice
===============

Here you'll get more familiar with defining and building vectors and using them
as function parameters and return values.

Prerequisites
-------------

You should understand how the code in the `VectorVowels` reading works.

Instructions
------------

Fill in the function definitions in the file `vector_practice.c++`. The
function `min()` is provided for you and returns a value equal to the smallest
of the values held by the vector parameter.

The function `sign()` should return a vector of values all equal to either 1,
0, or -1, according as the corresponding entry of the parameter is positive,
zero, or negative.

The function `num_pos()` returns a value equal to the number of positive
entries in the vector parameter.
