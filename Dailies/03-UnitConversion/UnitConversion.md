Unit conversion 
---------------

Visit the code scaffold file `unit_conversion.c++`. Follow along with the
instructor so that the program compiles and produces the following sample
output (when input is as indicated with red text):

    Enter the number of inches: 12
    That is 1 feet and 0 inches.

    Enter the number of inches: 34
    That is 2 feet and 10 inches.

    Enter the number of inches: 8
    That is 0 feet and 8 inches.

If you are annoyed by "1 feet", don't sweat it. I would be too. Soon we will
acquire <em>conditional statements</em>, the mechanism by which programs can
decide between several alternatives based on input (or other attributes of
program state).

-----------------------------

Modify your `unit_conversion.c++` program so that it converts into miles,
feet, and inches. 

    Enter the number of inches: 12
    That is 0 miles, 1 feet, and 0 inches.

    Enter the number of inches: 63365
    That is 1 miles, 0 feet, and 5 inches.
