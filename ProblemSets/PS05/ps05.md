Problem Set 05
==============

Due Tuesday, November 22:

* `monte_vector.c++`
* `solitaire.c++`

Instructions: `monte_vector.c++`
--------------------------------

Rewrite your Monte Carlo program from Problem Set 3 to incorporate the following changes. Submit the revised program as `monte_vector.c++`.

1. Use parameters of type `const int` for each of the following program values. Every time these values are needed in your program, you should use the named parameters instead of the literal values. For example, `DIE_SIZE` might be used instead of 6 (for the standard cubical die).

  * The least and greatest number of pips on each face of the die
  * The number of rolls
  * The number of faces of the die

2. Use a function to generate the random numbers (the die rolls) of the
   appropriate sizes. This function should be called from within your
   `main()` function.

3. Use a vector (of `int`s) to store the results of the rolls.

4. In the final display, show not just the frequency of each roll, but the
   percentage frequency, as a decimal percentage with 10 digits after the
   decimal point. (You will need to use some of the `iomanip` header file
   facilities to do this. Check the earlier sections of the book or online
   references like [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com).)

5. For a challenge, display the output in order of decreasing frequency rather
   than in numerical order of the rolls (see below for an example). WARNING:
   this is quite difficult compared to the rest of the exercise. This part is
   strictly optional. A modest amount of bonus credit may be awarded for
   working solutions.

Here is a sample run (without the challenge option). Remember, you do need to
show 10 decimal places in the percentages. Also, don't forget that this is
only a sample. Your program needs to be able to handle general side numbers
and so on.

    15-sided die with sides from 17 to 31 rolled 50000000 times. Results:
    17: 3335829 times (6.6716580000%)
    18: 3332414 times (6.6648280000%)

Instructions: `solitaire.c++`
-----------------------------

In the file `solitaire.c++`, do exercise P6.18 from Horstmann. Use vectors,
not arrays, for full credit. The instructions are:

Write a program `solitaire.c++` that models the game of *Bulgarian Solitaire*.
The game starts with 45 cards. (They need not be playing cards. Unmarked index
cards work just as well.) Randomly divide them into some number of piles of
random size. For example, you might start with piles of size 20, 5, 1, 9, and
10. In each round, you take one card from each pile, forming a new pile with
these cards. For example, the sample starting configuration would be
transformed into piles of size 19, 4, 8, 9, and 5. The solitaire is over
(why?) when the piles have size 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, in some order.
(It can be shown that you always end up with such a configuration.) In your
program, produce a random starting configuration and print it. Then keep
applying the solitaire step and print the result. Stop when the solitaire
final configuration is reached.


Make sure that your program produces visible output, showing each "play" of
the game. As always, your output should be professional and appropriate. Your
solution must use vectors only to receive full credit.

##### HINTS

You need a procedure---an algorithm---that handles all cases properly. Pay
special attention to piles of size 1 and 0. It would be very good to draw some
pictures of some example games to help you understand how these algorithms
could be specified. Of course, you are using functions to separate the
different parts of your algorithm. Write code in `main` to help you test these
functions and make sure they are working. Only write the real `main` code
after you think you are done with the functions.

##### Extra credit

If you finish, you can make your program cooler. Let the user begin the
session by specifying how many games of solitaire to play. Then, for each
game, have your program record the number of plays needed to reach the end
(use a vector). To end the session, output a summary showing interesting
statistics, such as average number of plays, max and min, and whatever else
you feel like including. Remember to be careful with division and to use
library functions if needed. You can earn up to 10 extra points.
