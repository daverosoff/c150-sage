Current event assignment
========================

Computer science is widely acknowledged to be an interdisciplinary academic
field. The automation of data tasks that computing promises is a large
fraction of the reason for this acknowledgement. The ubiquity of computing in
modern life is even more widely recognized and is difficult to discuss without
resort to cliché. Yet issues in computing and computer science do affect us
all. The present assignment is an examination of this interaction, from two
perspectives.

1. As computer users, how are we affected by current and recent developments
in academic and commercial computing, government computing policy, industry
trends (including finance or venture capital backing software development),
security, and so on?

2. As conscious programmers, how do the choices we make affect the lives of
others? For example, to what extent are banking app developers responsible for
the financial security of their users? What protections should social media
apps put in place to protect users from harassment or abuse?

Instructions
------------

Current events are done in pairs. For each current event you do, you can earn
up to 5 extra credit points toward Quizzes, according to the following rules:

1. The first current event is worth a maximum of 5 points.
2. Each subsequent current event is worth a maximum of 75% of the maximum
   possible points of the previous one.
3. Current events are scored individually. You may be eligible for more or fewer
   points than your partner depending on how many you have already done.

The scoring rubric is as follows.

1. (1 points) Summary of event. 400 words maximum giving a brief introduction
to the event and some analysis. Explain how the event is significant in terms
of the perspectives enumerated above.

2. (2 points) Piazza discussion. Make a post or two in Piazza to get a
discussion going. Include at least one poll question, so that I can track
participation.

2. (2 points) Class presentation. 3 minutes giving your summary to the class,
with a visual aid (slide or other). Each presenter must speak. Also summarize
the results of the online discussion, including the result of your polling.
