CSC-150 Current Events assignment
=================================

You can earn credit equivalent to one reading quiz by researching a current
event relevant to the field of computer science, writing 500 words describing
the event, and presenting to the class. Qualifying presentations are about 5
minutes long and include a visual aid. Essays must cite reliable sources such as
magazine or journal articles, research articles, or books.

Additional presentations are possible, but decrease in value. The second
presentation is worth 75% of a reading quiz, the third worth (75%)^2 = 56.25%,
the fourth (75%)^3 = 42.1875%, and so on.

Presentations may be done in pairs if the research is shared.

When you are ready to do a presentation, email me at least a day ahead of time
to reserve some time. We can do up to two per day, but no more than six in a
week.
